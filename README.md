# Semantic Segmentation with TensorFlow

This repository contains implementations and experiments related to **Semantic Segmentation** using TensorFlow, including DeepLabV3+ with ResNet-50 backbone.

## Project Overview
- Implementation of DeepLabV3+ for semantic segmentation
- Pre-trained weights and model checkpoints
- Jupyter notebooks for training and testing
- Example usage and evaluation scripts

## Repository Contents
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations
- `models/` : Model architecture and training scripts
- `weights/` : Pre-trained model weights (managed via Git LFS or linked externally)
- `data/` : Example datasets or download instructions

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone hhttps://github.com/yashpalsince2004/Bert_process.git
   cd Bert_process
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run example notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Day19_Attention_Transformers_Hinglish.ipynb
   ```

## Notes
- Due to GitHub file size restrictions, model weights are **not directly stored** in this repo. You can download them externally (links to be provided).
